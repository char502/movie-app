Series one was hosted by Adam Spencer, with series two hosted by Mike Goldman. Both series were co-hosted by New Zealand poker pro Lee Nelson and Australian model Laura Weston acted as hostess. The show was produced by Australian Production Company Freehand Group.\n\nThe show featured Australian comedians playing no-limit Texas hold'em poker. Four comedians compete in each episode on behalf of their chosen charity. It was recorded in the high rollers' room of Sydney's Star City Casino for the first season and in a studio at Fox Studios in Sydney for the second. The weekly winner donates $5,000 to charity, while the series winner donates $25,000.\n\nA New Zealand version also aired in 2007.",
